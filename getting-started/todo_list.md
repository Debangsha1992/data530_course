Things to do at the start of the course
=======================

There are several things you'll need to do at the start of the course to get set up with all the technology, accounts, and services we'll be using.
I've split these tasks up into several chunks so it's a bit more manageable. 
In the first chunk (Before the first class) are the same four things that you received through a Canvas Announcement.

It is now live on Canvas under the "Course Content" sidebar item. You can also [view it outside of Canvas here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data531).

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-3" class="box"> **2. Annotate the Syllabus.** </input></label> 

I want to know what you think of the syllabus! Yes, I want your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on how you want the course to go this term. If one of you has a good idea for a change, adjustment or addition - I'd love to adopt it if it fits with the course. I strongly believe that you are now in charge of your own education, and I am just a guide to help point you in the right direction. 

How should you annotate the syllabus? Well there's a really awesome tool called hypothes.is - when enabled, it allows anyone to highlight and comment on any website. I have turned this feature on for our course website. This is an experiment, and I encourage you to make comments and highlights on our syllabus. Let's see how it goes! Don't be shy, but please be respectful and courteous.

Here's what you need to do:

First click this link and Sign Up for Hypothes.is when it asks you to log in: [https://hypothes.is/groups/vB39EeGD/data301-students](https://hypothes.is/groups/q9RpwxVd/mds-2020-21).

*The Hypothes.is tool is stored on servers outside Canada. Please exercise caution whenever using personal information. If you would like to protect your identity, you may create an alternate email address and provide an alias/pseudonym rather than your real name and personal information.*

Next, go back to the Syllabus website (in Canvas or on the web) and click the "<" button at the right of the webpage.
Switch from "Public" to the "MDS-2020-21" group and annotate or highlight away!
I have attached a picture of what you should see.
